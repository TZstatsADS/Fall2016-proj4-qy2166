### Data folder

The data directory contains raw data used in training process and trained data used in testing process and predicting process. 

Raw data include lengthcount.RData, lyr.RData, sound.RData (sound.RData should be included in this folder, but since it is too big, it does not show up in this folder).

Trained data include fit_loudness.RData (fit_loudness.RData is a linear model), pitch_cluster.RData (pitch_cluster.RData is a k-mean cluster object), label20.RData, prob20.RData (label20.RData and prob20.RData are from topic modelling process), and rf_classification.RData (rf_classification.RData is a random forest object).
